Devendra Fadnavis, whose government is fighting a challenge over his swearing in from Sena-NCP-Cong-combine, got busy with work in his second stint as chief minister of Maharashtra by signing his first cheque for a relief fund.

The CMO Maharastra tweeted pictures of the CM signing his first cheque for the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. The new chief minister was then seen handing over the cheque to a woman.

“CM Devendra Fadnavis’ first signature of this tenure was done on a #CMReliefFund cheque, on reaching Mantralaya, which was handed over to Kusum Vengurlekar by CM,” the Chief Minister’s Office tweeted.

The BJP chief minister got a breather as the Supreme Court on Monday said it will pass an order at 10.30 am on Tuesday on the legality of the chief minister’s swearing in on Saturday, which the opposition alliance allege was conducted in a “hurried and makeshift” ceremony.

The Centre told a bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna that the governor had in absolute discretion invited the largest party to form government on November 23. It further said that the BJP had the support of all 54 NCP MLAs to form a government in Maharashtra.

The BJP is the single largest party with 105 MLAs in the 288-member state assembly followed by the Shiv Sena (56), NCP (54) and Congress (44). The Sena broke its three-decade-long ties with the BJP after the latter declined to share the chief minister’s post.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the BJP and some Independent MLAs, said Fadnavis had Ajit Pawar’s letter of assurance and they had submitted a list of 170 MLAs for forming government.

In Mumbai, leaders of the Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress on Monday submitted a letter to the governor, reiterating their claim that they have the required numbers to form government in the state.

Amid the continuing political drama and fear of ‘poaching’ of MLAs, the NCP shifted its legislators from a five-star resort to two other hotels in the city.

Congress legislators are at a suburban hotel in Andheri as are the Shiv sena’s MLAs. Senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan on Sunday alleged that BJP leaders had booked rooms in a hotel where his party MLAs were put up and were contacting some of them.

Over the past week, there were three Test matches which were going on simultaneously. Two of these, India vs Bangladesh and Australia vs Pakistan, were Test matches but only on paper. India smashed Bangladesh in less than three days while Australia got the better of Pakistan in four days by an innings and six runs.

However, the match between New Zealand and England went down to the final session of the final day and England, despite showing good fight, fell short and New Zealand bagged the match. It was a proper graft, it was pure Test cricket, but, well, it was not part of the World Test Championship. Yes, it was just another Test match and the result will have absolutely no bearing on the points table. So, we can all raise our eyebrows and question the scheduling all over again, but before we jump up and down, let us first understand, why this happened in the first place.
This is an anomaly - the introduction of the World Test Championship has impacted on the meaningfulness of this series. The format of the tournament mandates that each country would play six series under the Test Championship, with three of those being played at home while the others would be played overseas.

Hence, the series between England and New Zealand falls into the section of Test matches which will not be a part of the Test Championship because had it been a part, England would have played an away series more, which would have left the rest of the scheduling awry.

This World Test Championship is a good contest, but the scheduling is far from ideal. Indian captain Virat Kohli also suggested a format to make the World Test Championship more even... “A more balanced format would be one series home, one away. We are playing very good cricket but we have played only two Tests away,” said Kohli after the win against Bangladesh at Eden Gardens.
