      "To raiecapital the studio secured funding from a seven-year million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch\n",
      "Marvel s plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover film\n",

      "Feieinitially referred to the shared narratiecontinuity of these films as the Marvel Ciea Uniese but later used the term Marvel Cieatic Uniese\n",
      "Since the franchieexpanded to other media this phrase has been used by some to refer to the feature films only\n",
      "Marvel designated the Marvel Cieatic Uniese as Earth- within the continuity of the company s comic multiese a collection of fictional alternate unieses\n",
      "In November Feiesaid that in an iel world releases each year would include one film based on an existing character and one featuring a new character saying it s a nierhythm in that format\n",
      "Whienot always the case as eviet by the releases of Iron Man and Thor: The Dark World he said it is certainly something to aim for\n",
      "Feieexpanded on this in July saying I don t know that we ll keep to that model every year but we re doing that in and so I think it would be fun to continue that sort of thing\n",
      "In February Feiestated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the rhythm that the comic books have developed by having the characters appear in their own films and then come together much lie a big event or crossover series with Avengers films acting as big giant linchpins\n",
      "After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through in July Feiestated I think if you look at some of those dates that we ve announced we re going to three in a few of those years\n",
      "Again not because there s a number cruncher telling us to go to three do more than two pictures a year but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing existing franchie film to film and when we have a team ready to go why tell them to go away for four years just because we don t have a slot We d rather find a way to keep that going\n",
      "After the titles were revealed in October Feiesaid The studio s firing on all cylinders right now\n",

      "On expanding the characters in the uniese and letting individual films breathe and work on their own as opposed to having Avenger team-ups outsieof Avengers films Feiestated it s about teaching the general movie-going audience about the notion of the characters existing separately coming together for specific events and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again\n",

      "we still have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprieourselves in places that we end up\n",
      "So that all the movies hopefully when they re finished will feel liethey re all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead but really can lieand breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves\n",
      "The studio also has various contingency plans for the dietion of all of their films in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to repriea role or re-acquiethe film rights to a character such as was done in February with Spie-Man\n",
      "In April on moving the uniese to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three Feiesaid I think there will be a finality to moments of Phase Three as well as new beginnings that will mark a different a very different a distinctiey different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases\n",
